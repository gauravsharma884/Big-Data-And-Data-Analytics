## About the projects:
### Start Up Succes Prediction
This project script is created to construct a model that can forecast the success of a StartUp on the basis of different variables and to  determine which factors facilitates most in the success of a startup

- Context

A startup or start-up is a company or project begun by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable economic model. While entrepreneurship refers to all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that never intend to become registered, startups refer to new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo founder. Startups face high uncertainty and have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to be successful and influential. Some startups become unicorns: privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion. [Source of information: Wikipedia]

Startups play a major role in economic growth. They bring new ideas, spur innovation, create employment thereby moving the economy. There has been an exponential growth in startups over the past few years. Predicting the success of a startup allows investors to find companies that have the potential for rapid growth, thereby allowing them to be one step ahead of the competition.
 
 
- Problem Statement

Startup is a business that has just been established and grown supported by digital services and has also become an important element of innovation systems and economies around the world. The Startup ecosystem is growing very rapidly and still needs a lot of funding to operate with a minimalist working group. So it is very important for VC to monitor the performance and performance of Startup, so that it can be used as a consideration to decide whether to fund a Startup to drive its growth or refuse to take part in funding. To monitor startup performance, it is important to analyze what makes a Startup successful and how to determine its success.


- Goal

The goal to be achieved is to determine whether a StartUp will be successful or not.
